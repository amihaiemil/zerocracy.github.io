  Zerocracy solves a number of problems we
  all experience in software development projects,
  and helps optimize costs and increase quality.

Despite all the efforts,
[most](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf)
software projects suffer
[from](https://www.infoq.com/articles/software-failure-reasons):

  * High labor costs
  * High and damaging turnover of personnel
  * Low maintainability
  * Low quality of code
  * High volume of defects

We believe that most of the above is caused by broken
management, not technical incompetence. To solve that, we
suggest to <del>replace</del> empower a human project manager with
[Zerocrat](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html),
a hosted chat bot.
To make a project manageable by a computer, we use a strict
[Policy](/policy.html), which derives the following principles from
[eXtremely Distributed Software Development](http://www.xdsd.org) methodology:

  * [**No Chats**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html):<br/>
    Programmers don't talk to each other anywhere outside of GitHub tickets.

  * [**Microtasking**](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html):<br/>
    Each task has a [fixed](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html)
    [budget](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#4) of less than an hour.

  * [**No Excuses**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html):<br/>
    We pay only for deliverables when a task is
    [finished](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html).

  * [**Individualism**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html):<br/>
    Each task has an assignee who is fully responsible for its completion.

  * [**No Help**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html):<br/>
    We don't teach programmers and don't help them.

  * [**Laziness**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html):<br/>
    We encourage programmers to cut corners
    [wherever](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    they can.

  * [**Pay Per Bug**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html):<br/>
    We encourage programmers to find bugs and we [pay for them](http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#29).

We realize that our approach is very much
[different](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) from all other
traditional methods of management. In our experience
our way of managing projects gives a lot of benefits to
all [stakeholders](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html):

  * Programmers are more [motivated](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html)
  * Costs are [lower](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html)
  * Quality is [higher](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html)
  * Maintainability is higher and turnover doesn't hurt

and one of our architects will get in touch with you.
