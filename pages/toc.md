  Zerocracy solves a number of problems we
  all experience in software development projects,
  and helps optimize costs and increase quality.

Despite all the efforts,
[most](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf)
software projects suffer
[from](https://www.infoq.com/articles/software-failure-reasons):

  * High labor costs
  * High and damaging turnover of personnel
  * Low maintainability
  * Low quality of code
  * High volume of defects

We believe that most of the above is caused by broken
management, not technical incompetence. To solve that, we
suggest to <del>replace</del> empower a human project manager with
[Zerocrat](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html),
a hosted chat bot.
To make a project manageable by a computer, we use a strict
[Policy](/policy.html) of work, which derives the following principles from
[eXtremely Distributed Software Development](http://www.xdsd.org) methodology.

[**No Chats**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html):
programmers don't talk to each other in chats or meetings, everything
happens in GitHub tickets.

[**Microtasking**](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html):
each task assigned to a programmer has a fixed
[budget](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html) of 30 minutes.

[**No Excuses**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html):
we pay a fixed budget when the task is
[finished](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html),
no matter how much time a programmer spent on it; we don't reimburse any other expenses.

[**Individualism**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html):
each task has an assignee who is fully responsible for completing
the task.

[**No Help**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html):
we don't teach programmers and never invest anything in their education;
instead, we invest into project documentation and source code.

[**Laziness**](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html):
we ask programmers to be as lazy as possible and cut corners
[wherever](http://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
they can.

[**Pay Per Bug**](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html):
we pay a fixed 15 minutes fee for each bug found and
encourage programmers to find as many of them as possible.

We realize that our approach is very much
[different](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) from all other
traditional methods of management. In our experience
our approach gives a lot of benefits to
all project [stakeholders](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html):

  * Programmers are more [motivated](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html)
  * Costs are [lower](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html)
  * Quality is [higher](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html)
  * Maintainability is higher and turnover doesn't hurt
